## Culvert Vulnerability Assessment Application

The **Culvert Vulnerability Assessment App** is a comprehensive geospatial tool designed to evaluate the hydrologic and hydrogeomorphologic vulnerability of culverts and related infrastructure. It integrates watershed delineation, hydrologic analysis, and terrain-based assessment methods to support infrastructure planning, disaster resilience, and environmental safety.

### üß≠ Steps in Watershed Delineation

1. **Boundary Region (Mandatory)**

   - Input type: `.zip` (shapefile) or `.shp`
   - Defines the outer limits of the study region.

2. **DEM Data Raster (Mandatory)**

   - Input type: `.tif`
   - Digital Elevation Model is used for flow direction and accumulation analysis.

3. **Pour Point Data (Optional)**

   - Examples: Culverts, bridges, fords, or any outlet points.
   - Enhances precision in delineating watershed boundaries to real-world infrastructure.

4. **Stream Delineation Parameters (Mandatory)**

   - Example parameters:
     - Flow accumulation threshold
     - Minimum stream length

5. **Hydro-Enforcement Parameters (Optional)**
   - Placeholder parameters:
     - Sink filling method
     - Stream burning depth
     - Depression breaching
     - Culvert insertion method

## ‚úÖ Summary

The **Culvert Vulnerability App** provides a comprehensive geospatial decision-support system with three integrated modules:

- **Watershed Delineation:** Data-driven delineation of upstream hydrologic networks.
- **Hydrologic Assessment:** Quantifies runoff risks using multiple hydrologic models.
- **Hydrogeomorphologic Assessment:** Evaluates terrain-driven vulnerabilities using both qualitative and quantitative models.

It supports climate-resilient infrastructure planning by integrating hydrologic and geomorphologic modeling at various spatial scales.
